Overview
========================================================

This presentation was built as part of a deliverable for the course Developing Data Products as part of the Coursera Data Science Specialization. Course 9 - Week 4. (c9w4b)

The data used was based in Diamonds information.

- Running code: https://dcialdella.shinyapps.io/c9w4/
- The source code: https://github.com/dcialdella/c9w4
- The PPT stored on: https://dcialdella.shinyapps.io/c9w4/
- Relevant info: http://www.lumeradiamonds.com/diamond-education/index

Rules to take care about it:

- Shiny used to build data product application demo.
- R-presentation editor to create the Presentation associated.
- Information provided by Cityhall Alcal√° de Henares.


Slide Reference data
========================================================
Welcome page, show VARs to complete/Select, brief detail about the data and the information provided.
VARIABLES
- Price - will show line with this referenced value
- Carat - Used to select Carat (between 0.2 and 5.01)
- Color - Select quality (0-all, 1 to 7 means I to D quality)
- Records - Select records used for the process (try to test it with a few records first)
- Show/Hide - Used as boolean var to show/hide reference lines on graphics

You could refresh all graphics in all tabs.

```{r c1, echo=FALSE}
library('ggplot2')
summary(diamonds)

g <- diamonds$price


```

Slide With Histogram Graphic
========================================================

```{r c2, echo=FALSE}
library('ggplot2')
g <- diamonds$price

h <- hist( g, breaks=10, density=10, col="green", xlab="Prices", main=paste("Hist. Prices & filtered Color - ALL") )
xfit <- seq(min(g),max(g),length=40 )
yfit <- dnorm(xfit,mean=mean(g),sd=sd(g) )
yfit <- yfit*diff(h$mids[1:2])*length(g)

# h
lines( xfit, yfit, col="red", lwd=2)
abline( v=5300, col="red", lwd=2 )

```

Slide with Comparatives Graphic
========================================================

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library('ggplot2')
d <- diamonds

plot(d$carat, d$price, main="Scatterplot Carat / Price",
     xlab="Prices ", ylab="Price / Carat", pch=19 , col=c("red","blue","green","yellow","pink","black","grey") )
legend( "bottomright", c("D-Red","E-Blue","F-Green","G-Yellow","H-pink","I-Black","J-Grey") )

abline(lm(d$price~d$carat), col="red", lwd=4)
lines( lowess(d$carat,d$price), col="blue", lwd=4)

```
